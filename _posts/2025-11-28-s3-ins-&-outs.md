Do you ever think that when you click a movie in Netflix , and in just two or three seconds the stream begins.The file behind that movie is enormous—gigabytes of HD or 4K video.So how does Netflix deliver it instantly?

Later, you start browsing Airbnb for a weekend trip.
Images appear instantly: bedrooms, kitchens, city views from different hosts. But none of these images are stored on Airbnb servers.

Because the entire library of Netflix originals is stored inside Amazon S3. Every single picture you see was uploaded by a host and stored inside S3.

Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS, and it is basically an `infinitely scaling` storage.

## S3 Use Cases
- Backup and Storage 
- Disaster Recovery 
- Archive 
- Hybrid Cloud Storage
- Application Hosting
- Media Hosting
- Data Lakes and Big data Analytics
- Software delivery

> **Examples:** Nasdaq stores 7 years of data into S3 & Sysco runs analytics on its data and gain business insights!

# Amazon S3 Bucket and S3 Objects

![alt text](../assets/Images/s3-3.jpg)

Buckets are like the directories and objects are like the files in the aws cloud.

**For objects:** Need a key(prefix + object_name)

**Analogy:** You are creating a folder and saving an image there. Same thing you will do in the cloud but for folder there is Buckets and for files there is Objects!
